# UI Interface

This document describes the user interface components and interaction model for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server project.

## Overview

The MCP server provides a web-based user interface that allows users to:

1. Query the Cardano knowledge base
2. Browse documentation by categories
3. Explore GitHub repositories
4. Execute tools and process information
5. Visualize relationships between resources

## Architecture

The UI follows a component-based architecture using modern web technologies:

```

│   ├── Navigation
│   ├── Search
│   ├── Visualization
│   └── Content Display
├── Feature Components
│   ├── Documentation Explorer
│   ├── Repository Browser
│   ├── Knowledge Graph
│   └── Tool Execution
└── Shared Components
    ├── Code Blocks
    ├── Markdown Renderer
    ├── Loading States
    └── Error Handling
```

## Key Components

### Navigation System

The navigation component provides:

- Breadcrumb navigation for context awareness
- Sidebar navigation for quick access to major sections
- History tracking and back/forward navigation
- Resource bookmarking

### Search Interface

The search component includes:

- Natural language query support
- Semantic search capabilities
- Typeahead suggestions
- Filter options for sources, topics, and content types
- Relevance ranking

### Content Display

Content is displayed with:

- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Expandable/collapsible sections
- Dynamic table of contents
- Dark/light mode support

### Knowledge Graph Visualization

The knowledge graph provides:

- Interactive visualization of related concepts
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Filtering by relationship types
- Focus on specific nodes

## Interaction Model

### User Flow

The primary user flow follows these steps:

1. **Entry**: User enters the application and is presented with the main dashboard
2. **Discovery**: User can browse documentation categories or repositories
3. **Search**: User can search for specific topics or concepts
4. **Exploration**: User can explore relationships between resources
5. **Interaction**: User can execute tools and process information

### Query Processing

When a user submits a query:

1. The query is processed by the server
2. Relevant resources are retrieved from the knowledge base
3. Results are ranked by relevance
4. Information is presented in an easily digestible format
5. Related concepts and resources are suggested

## Responsive Design

The UI is designed to be responsive across different devices and screen sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full-featured interface with all components visible
- **Tablet**: Streamlined interface with collapsible sections
- **Mobile**: Essential functionality with focused content display

## Accessibility

The UI follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility:

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Sufficient color contrast
- Text scaling without loss of functionality
- Alternative text for images and visualizations

## Theming

The UI supports both light and dark themes, with customization options for:

- Color schemes
- Font sizes
- Content density
- Code highlighting styles

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Context API with reducers
- **Styling**: CSS Modules with CSS variables
- **API Communication**: Fetch API with typed responses
- **Visualization**: D3.js for knowledge graph
- **Code Highlighting**: Prism.js for syntax highlighting

### Code Structure

```

├── components/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── features/
│   └── shared/
├── hooks/
├── contexts/
├── services/
├── utils/
├── types/
└── pages/
```

## Configuration

The UI can be configured through environment variables and settings:

```typescript
// Environment configuration
interface UIConfig {
  apiBaseUrl: string;
  defaultPageSize: number;
  searchDebounceTime: number;
  maxSearchResults: number;
  enableExperimentalFeatures: boolean;
}
```

## Testing

The UI is tested with:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Testing user flows
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensuring compliance with accessibility standards

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the UI include:

- **Advanced Visualization**: Enhanced knowledge graph visualization
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational interface for natural interaction
- **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable dashboards
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Shared viewing and annotation
- **Integration with IDE**: Direct integration with development environments
- **Mobile Application**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android

## Getting Started

To run the UI locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev:ui

# Build for production
npm run build:ui
```

## API Integration

The UI communicates with the MCP server through a set of RESTful APIs:

```typescript
// Example API usage
async function searchDocumentation(query: string): Promise<SearchResult[]> {
  const response = await fetch(`${config.apiBaseUrl}/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`);
  return response.json();
}
```

## User Feedback

The UI collects user feedback to improve the quality of results:

- Rating system for search results
- Suggestion submission for missing information
- Usage analytics for identifying popular content
