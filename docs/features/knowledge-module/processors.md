# Documentation Processing Architecture

## Overview

The documentation processing system is responsible for fetching, parsing, and processing documentation from various sources. The system has been refactored to follow SOLID principles, with a focus on single responsibility and improved testability.

## Architecture

The processing system is now composed of specialized components:

```
knowledge/processors/
├── ContentCleaner.ts       # Removes unwanted HTML elements and extracts text
├── HtmlValidator.ts        # Validates HTML structure and syntax
├── MarkdownProcessor.ts    # Converts and validates Markdown content
├── MetadataGenerator.ts    # Generates metadata for documentation sections
├── SectionExtractor.ts     # Extracts sections from HTML content
├── documentationFetcher.ts # Fetches documentation from sources
└── documentationParser.ts  # Coordinates parsing process
```

### Component Responsibilities

#### DocumentationFetcher

Responsible for retrieving documentation from external sources with features like:

- Retry handling for network issues
- Concurrent request management
- Timeout handling
- HTTP error response handling

#### DocumentationParser

Acts as a coordinator that delegates specialized tasks to the appropriate components:

- HTML validation is delegated to `HtmlValidator`
- Content extraction is delegated to `SectionExtractor`
- Markdown processing is delegated to `MarkdownProcessor`
- Metadata generation is delegated to `MetadataGenerator`

#### HtmlValidator

Validates HTML content to ensure it meets the required standards:

- Checks for balanced tags
- Validates tag names
- Ensures adherence to allowed tags configuration
- Can be configured for lenient or strict parsing

#### ContentCleaner

Sanitizes and extracts clean content from HTML:

- Removes unwanted elements (scripts, styles, etc.)
- Extracts plain text content
- Identifies and extracts main content areas
- Handles HTML entities

#### SectionExtractor

Extracts structured sections from HTML content:

- Identifies sections based on heading elements
- Extracts code blocks within sections
- Handles configuration for title length and content requirements
- Supports custom selectors for identifying sections

#### MarkdownProcessor

Handles Markdown content processing:

- Converts Markdown to HTML
- Validates Markdown structure
- Supports GitHub Flavored Markdown
- Configurable for syntax highlighting

#### MetadataGenerator

Generates metadata for documentation sections:

- Creates unique IDs for sections
- Generates navigation paths
- Extracts topics from content
- Orders sections based on hierarchy

## Design Patterns

### Facade Pattern

The `DocumentationParser` serves as a facade, providing a simplified interface to the complex subsystem of specialized processors.

### Strategy Pattern

Components like `HtmlValidator` and `ContentCleaner` implement different strategies based on their configuration.

### Factory Pattern

The error handling system uses factories to create specialized error types:

- `ErrorFactory` for general documentation errors
- `NetworkErrorFactory` for network-related errors

## Error Handling

The system uses a robust error handling framework:

- `AppError` as the base error class
- Specialized factories for creating context-rich errors
- `RetryHandler` for managing retry logic with network errors
- Consistent error propagation for debugging

## Testing Approach

Each component is thoroughly tested:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Error handling tests to ensure errors are properly managed
- Mock network responses for fetcher tests

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to extend by adding new specialized components
3. **Improved Testability**: Smaller, focused classes are easier to test and mock
4. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect don't affect others
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Methods are shorter and more focused
6. **Better Documentation**: Each class has clear JSDoc comments
7. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Consistent and context-rich error management

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create instances of the components
const fetcher = new DocumentationFetcher({
  maxConcurrent: 2,
  timeout: 5000,
  maxRetries: 3,
});

const parser = new DocumentationParser({
  maxTitleLength: 100,
  minContentLength: 10,
  extractCodeBlocks: true,
});

// Fetch documentation
const source = {
  id: 'example-docs',
  location: 'https://example.com/docs',
  type: 'web',
};

// Process documentation
try {
  const fetchResult = await fetcher.fetch(source);
  const sections = await parser.parseHtml(fetchResult.content);

  // Generate metadata for sections
  const sectionsWithMetadata = sections.map((section) => ({
    ...section,
    metadata: parser.generateMetadata(section, source.id, source.location),
  }));

  // Use the processed documentation
  console.log(`Processed ${sectionsWithMetadata.length} sections`);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle errors with context
  if (error instanceof AppError) {
    console.error(`${error.code}: ${error.message}`, error.context);
  } else {
    console.error('Unexpected error', error);
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements to the documentation processing system:

1. Adding support for additional document formats (PDF, Word, etc.)
2. Implementing caching for fetched documentation
3. Adding natural language processing for better topic extraction
4. Supporting documentation versioning
5. Implementing a priority system for concurrent requests
