# Test Configuration Fixes

This document explains the improvements made to the test configuration to address reliability issues with test execution, particularly around server startup, test hanging, and inconsistent mock server behavior.

## Problems Addressed

1. **Server Startup Timeout**

   - Tests were failing with "Server startup timeout" errors when the mock server didn't start within the expected timeframe (5 seconds)
   - The error occurred in the tests/setup.ts file at line 10
   - Multiple test suites were affected, even those unrelated to server functionality

2. **Jest Not Exiting After Tests**

   - Jest wasn't properly exiting after test completion
   - The message "Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed" would appear
   - This was caused by untracked open handles, particularly in the server cleanup process

3. **Inconsistent Mock Server Behavior**
   - The mock server used for testing sometimes wouldn't initialize properly
   - This caused cascading failures in tests that depend on the server
   - Server readiness detection was unreliable

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Test Setup (tests/setup.ts)

- **Configurable Timeouts**
  - Added environment variable support for configuring timeout values
  - Set more reasonable default timeouts (15 seconds for server startup)
  - Default values are now centralized and documented
- **Robust Server Health Detection**
  - Implemented exponential backoff for server connection attempts
  - Added detailed logging for startup progress and failures
  - Created proper error messages with contextual information
- **Proper Handle Tracking and Cleanup**
  - All open handles (sockets, timers) are now tracked and properly cleaned up
  - Added explicit cleanup in both success and failure cases
  - Implemented proper shutdown sequence for the mock server

### 2. Enhanced Mock Server (src/mock/mock-server.ts)

- **Health Check & Readiness Endpoints**
  - Added `/health` endpoint to check server status
  - Added `/ready` endpoint that returns 200 only when both HTTP and WebSocket servers are ready
  - Added explicit server state tracking
- **Graceful Shutdown**
  - Implemented proper shutdown sequence
  - Added signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT
  - Ensured all connections are closed on shutdown
- **Better Logging**
  - Added request logging
  - Added explicit readiness signals
  - Added detailed error logging

### 3. Test Categories (jest.config.js)

- **Test Projects**
  - Separated tests into three categories: Unit, Server, and Repositories
  - Unit tests don't use the server setup
  - Server tests use the server setup
  - Repository tests have their own specialized configuration
- **Global Configuration**
  - Increased default test timeout to 15 seconds
  - Added detectOpenHandles flag to identify hanging resources
  - Added forceExit to ensure Jest exits cleanly
  - Added environment variable support for test configuration

### 4. Test Utilities (tests/utils/testUtils.ts)

- **Server Readiness Utilities**
  - Added isServerReady function to check server status
  - Added waitForServerReady function with exponential backoff
  - Added getServerHealth function for server diagnostics
- **Retry Mechanism**
  - Added retry utility for handling transient failures
  - Added withServerRetry wrapper for tests requiring server connectivity
  - Implemented smart retry conditions for network-related errors

### 5. Specialized Test Scripts (package.json)

- **Test Category Scripts**
  - Added test:unit script for unit tests only
  - Added test:server script for server tests
  - Added test:repos script for repository tests
  - Added test:debug script for debugging test issues
  - Added test:ci script for continuous integration
- **Mock Server Scripts**
  - Added mock-server:debug script with enhanced logging
  - Updated validate script to focus on unit tests first

## Usage

### Running Different Test Categories

```bash
# Run unit tests only (no server required)
npm run test:unit

# Run server tests (requires mock server)
npm run test:server

# Run repository tests
npm run test:repos

# Debug test issues
npm run test:debug
```

### Configuring Test Environment

You can configure test timeouts and behavior using environment variables:

```bash
# Increase server startup timeout to 30 seconds
SERVER_STARTUP_TIMEOUT=30000 npm run test:server

# Use custom ports for testing
HTTP_PORT=4000 WS_PORT=4001 npm run test:server

# Run tests with detailed logging
DEBUG=true npm run test:debug
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use the Appropriate Test Script**

   - Use test:unit for tests that don't need the server
   - Use test:server only for tests that require the mock server
   - Use test:repos for repository-related tests

2. **Use Test Utilities**

   - Import the retry and withServerRetry utilities for server-dependent tests
   - Use proper error handling and retries for network operations

3. **Server Health Checking**

   - Use the isServerReady and waitForServerReady functions
   - Add explicit health checks before server-dependent operations

4. **Test Isolation**
   - Keep unit tests independent of server functionality
   - Design tests to be resilient to external dependencies
   - Use proper mocking for external services

## Further Improvements

While the current changes significantly improve test reliability, some additional improvements could be made in the future:

1. **Containerized Testing**

   - Run tests in isolated containers to prevent port conflicts
   - Implement Docker Compose for test environment setup

2. **Mock Transport Layer**

   - Create a pure in-memory transport for MCP server testing
   - Eliminate network dependencies for higher reliability

3. **Test Database**

   - Implement an isolated test database
   - Add automated setup and teardown for database tests

4. **Parallel Testing**

   - Configure tests to run in parallel safely
   - Implement resource locking for shared resources

5. **Test Metrics**
   - Track test reliability over time
   - Identify flaky tests automatically
   - Implement test result analysis
