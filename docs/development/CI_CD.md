# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

_Last Updated: March 7th, 2025_

This document describes the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for the Cardano MCP project.

## Current Implementation

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and is currently in development. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Pipeline Structure

The current pipeline structure includes the following jobs:

1. **Quality Gates**

   - ESLint for code quality enforcement
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Prettier formatting verification
   - Runs on every push and pull request

2. **Build and Test**

   - Compiles the TypeScript codebase
   - Runs unit and integration tests for all modules
   - Executes tests in parallel for better performance
   - Enforces test coverage thresholds (>90% line coverage)
   - Depends on successful quality gates

3. **Security Scanning (Planned)**

   - CodeQL analysis for security vulnerabilities
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Custom security rule enforcement

4. **Documentation Generation (Planned)**
   - Automated TypeScript documentation generation
   - Documentation artifact publishing
   - API documentation updates

### Current Status

As of March 7th, 2025, the pipeline is functional but still being refined:

- Quality gates are operational
- Build and test processes are functioning
- Test coverage thresholds are enforced
- Several areas need optimization for stability and performance
- Security scanning and documentation generation are planned but not fully implemented

## Improvement Roadmap

We're implementing a phased approach to CI/CD improvements:

### Phase 1: Complete Initial Pipeline Setup (1 week)

- Finish GitHub Actions workflow implementation
- Stabilize quality gates and build process
- Configure proper test execution with parallel runs
- Fix issues with pipeline reliability
- Ensure proper reporting for build failures

### Phase 2: Improve ESLint Compliance (1-2 weeks)

- Address actual ESLint errors rather than suppressing them as warnings
- Create specific .eslintignore rules for problematic areas
- Apply targeted fixes for frequently occurring issues
- Implement automated ESLint fixing in the pre-commit hook

### Phase 3: Enhance Test Coverage (2 weeks)

- Optimize test execution and reporting
- Implement test result aggregation
- Add detailed coverage reports for each module
- Set up test performance monitoring
- Fix mock server cleanup issues

### Phase 4: Enable Security Scanning (2 weeks)

- Configure CodeQL analysis with appropriate settings
- Add dependency vulnerability scanning
- Implement security policy enforcement
- Create automated security issue reporting

### Phase 5: Documentation and Monitoring (2 weeks)

- Enhance documentation generation and publishing
- Implement documentation versioning
- Add pipeline metrics tracking
- Create dashboard for visualizing pipeline health
- Set up notifications for pipeline status

### Phase 6: Deployment Automation (3-4 weeks)

- Implement automated deployment to staging environment
- Add deployment verification tests
- Create rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- Set up production deployment with approval gates
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts

## Pipeline Conventions

### Branch Protection Rules

- The `main` branch is protected and requires passing CI checks before merging
- Pull requests must have at least one approval
- Status checks must pass before merging

### Commit Message Format

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types include:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation change
- `style`: Formatting change
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Test addition or correction
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Build and Test" Job Fails

1. Check the job logs for specific test failures
2. Run the failing tests locally with verbose output
3. Verify that all dependencies are properly installed
4. Check for environment-specific issues

### ESLint or TypeScript Errors

1. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` locally
2. Address all reported issues before pushing
3. For type errors, ensure proper interface implementations

### Coverage Threshold Failures

1. Run `npm run test:coverage` locally to identify coverage gaps
2. Add tests for uncovered code paths
3. If thresholds are too strict for certain modules, discuss adjustments with maintainers

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with code quality platforms
- Automatic changelog generation
- Performance regression testing
- Load and stress testing automation
- Cross-platform build verification
- Mobile build pipeline integration
