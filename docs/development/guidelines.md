# Development Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle
- Prioritize functionality and security over perfect code
- Make deliberate decisions about technical debt
- Document decisions and rationales

## Priority Levels

### P0 - Critical (Must Fix Immediately)

- Runtime errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Broken functionality
- Failed tests
- Blocking issues affecting other developers

### P1 - Important (Should Fix Soon)

- Type errors that could lead to runtime issues
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete security checks
- Performance issues affecting user experience
- Documentation gaps in critical features

### P2 - Nice to Have (Fix When Convenient)

- Linting warnings
- `any` type usage in TypeScript
- Unused imports
- Style inconsistencies
- Minor documentation improvements

## Handling Strategy

### For P0 Issues

```typescript
// Example of handling critical issues
try {
  // Critical functionality
} catch (error) {
  // Proper error handling
  logger.error('Critical error:', error);
  // Appropriate recovery or graceful degradation
}
```

- Fix immediately
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Document the fix
- Create post-mortem if necessary
- Update relevant documentation

### For P1 Issues

```typescript
// TODO: [TICKET-123] Improve type safety in authentication flow
// @ts-expect-error Temporary solution until proper types are implemented
function authenticate(user: any) {
  // Current implementation
}
```

- Create detailed tickets
- Fix in the next planned refactor
- Add TODO comments with ticket references
- Document in technical debt registry

### For P2 Issues

```typescript
// Technical Debt Item: Unused import cleanup needed
// Priority: P2
// Created: [Date]
// Ticket: TECH-456
// @ts-ignore
import { unusedUtil } from './utils';
```

- Use appropriate ignore comments with explanations
- Track in technical debt document
- Batch fix during cleanup sprints

## Decision Framework

Before fixing any issue, ask:

1. Is it affecting functionality?
2. Is it a security concern?
3. Is it blocking other development?
4. What's the cost/benefit of fixing it now vs. later?

## Documentation Template

```markdown
## Technical Debt Item

### Description

Brief description of the issue

### Priority

P[0-2]

### Created

[Date]

### Ticket

[Link or ID]

### Location

[File path and line numbers]

### Rationale

Why we're deferring this fix

### Acceptance Criteria

What needs to be done to consider this resolved

### Notes

Any additional context or considerations
```

## Implementation Example

```typescript
// Technical Debt Item: Type safety improvement needed
// Priority: P2
// Created: 2024-03-21
// Ticket: TECH-789
// @ts-ignore Temporarily allowing any type until proper interface is defined
function processData(data: any) {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Review Process

### When to Review Technical Debt

- During sprint planning
- Before major releases
- During dedicated cleanup sprints
- When related code is being modified

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Are any P0 items pending?
- [ ] Have P1 items been properly ticketed?
- [ ] Is technical debt documented?
- [ ] Are ignore comments properly explained?
- [ ] Is the debt registry up to date?

## Maintenance

This document should be:

- Reviewed quarterly
- Updated based on team feedback
- Used in code reviews
- Referenced in pull request templates

Remember: The goal is to maintain high-quality code while being pragmatic about development speed and resource allocation.
