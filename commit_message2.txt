This commit includes additional supporting files for our test configuration:

1. Test Utilities:
   - Added tests/utils/testUtils.ts with common testing functions
   - Updated tests/setup.ts with improved mock server handling

2. Documentation:
   - Added detailed test category documentation
   - Added test configuration troubleshooting guide

3. Mock Server Improvements:
   - Enhanced error handling in mock server
   - Improved shutdown process to prevent hanging tests

These changes complete our test infrastructure improvements by
providing better test utilities, documentation, and fixing
issues with the mock server setup.
