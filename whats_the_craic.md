## 🔧 Current Issues

### 1. Minor Mock Server Cleanup Issue

- A minor issue with an open handle (PIPEWRAP) persists in the tests/setup.ts file
- This doesn't affect test functionality but causes Jest to exit with a warning
- The root cause is in the spawn process for the mock server
- A cleanup process has been implemented but could be further improved

### 2. Authentication Dialog Issue (Partially Resolved)

- An authentication dialog occasionally appears requesting access to "Default keyring"
- This dialog may interfere with automated tests and CI/CD pipeline
- The dialog appears to be related to Puppeteer's Chrome instance attempting to access system keyrings
- Initial mitigation implemented:
  - Added Chrome flags to disable password manager and use mock keychain
  - Set environment variables to skip credential storage
  - Modified browser launch configuration to prevent system keyring access
- Further testing needed to confirm the solution is effective in CI/CD environments

### 3. JavaScript-rendered Site Processing Challenges

- Some documentation sites heavily rely on JavaScript for content rendering
- Initial JavaScript rendering implementation using Puppeteer works but faces challenges:
  - Timeout issues with some complex sites (e.g., docs.cardano.org)
  - Content structure varies significantly between sites
  - Performance impacts of headless browser rendering
- Planned improvements include content structure detection and adaptive rendering strategies
